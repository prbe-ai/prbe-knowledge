# prbe-knowledge

Phase 0 knowledge layer for PRBE. Multi-source ingestion (Slack, Linear, GitHub, Notion, Sentry) + retrieval service for agent orchestration.

**Status:** scaffold.

## Architecture

Two FastAPI services deployed to Fly.io:

- `services/ingestion/` — webhook fast path (R2 persist + queue insert) + async worker (parse → fetch → normalize → chunk → embed → upsert)
- `services/retrieval/` — `/query` endpoint: router (Haiku entity extraction) + parallel retrieval (pgvector HNSW + BM25 + relational graph) + RRF fusion + dedup

Storage:

- Neon Postgres 16 + pgvector (chunks, documents, graph, ACL snapshots, queue)
- Cloudflare R2 bucket-per-tenant (raw webhook payloads)

Full design: [`docs/phase0-design.md`](docs/phase0-design.md)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Docker + Docker Compose (for local dev)
- `psql` client — `brew install libpq && brew link --force libpq`

## Local dev setup

```bash
# 1. Start local Postgres + MinIO
docker compose up -d

# 2. Create venv + install deps
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 3. Apply schema migration to local Postgres
scripts/neon-migrate.sh local
```

Local Postgres runs at `localhost:5432` (user `prbe`, pass `prbe`, db `prbe_knowledge`).
MinIO runs at `localhost:9000` (console `localhost:9001`, user `minioadmin`/`minioadmin`).

## Deploying the schema to Neon

Three branches: `dev`, `staging`, `main`. Each has its own compute endpoint and its own connection string.

Connection strings are stored in the **macOS Keychain** so they never land in shell history, `.env` files, or git.

### One-time setup per branch

For each branch:

1. Neon console → project `prbe-knowledge` → branch dropdown (top-left) → pick the branch
2. Click **Connect** → copy the full `postgresql://...` URL (Cmd+C)
3. Run:
   ```bash
   scripts/neon-store.sh dev        # or staging, or main
   ```

The script reads the URL from the macOS clipboard (pbpaste), validates it starts with `postgresql://`, strips any accidental line breaks from UI wrapping, and stores it in the macOS Keychain under service `neon-prbe-knowledge`, account `<branch>`.

It prints the parsed hostname and URL length so you can confirm the right branch landed:

```
Stored in Keychain.
  Service:    neon-prbe-knowledge
  Account:    dev
  Host:       ep-lively-star-am6vuivm-pooler.c-5.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech
  URL length: 147 chars
```

A URL length under 120 chars is flagged as suspicious — usually a truncated paste.

To overwrite after rotating the password, copy the new URL and re-run the same command. The script uses `-U` (update if exists) so there's no delete step.

### Apply the migration

```bash
scripts/neon-migrate.sh dev        # migrate dev branch
scripts/neon-migrate.sh staging    # migrate staging branch
scripts/neon-migrate.sh main       # migrate prod
scripts/neon-migrate.sh local      # migrate local docker-compose instead
```

### Reset a branch (pre-launch only, DESTRUCTIVE)

```bash
scripts/neon-reset.sh dev
```

Drops all Phase 0 tables on the target and re-runs the migration from scratch. Use this when the schema is still fluid and you'd rather rebuild clean than write an alter-table migration. Prompts for confirmation — you have to type the branch name to proceed.

**Do not run this after real customer data exists.** Once production data lands, changes go through forward-only Alembic migrations (new revision files), not a reset.

Under the hood it:

1. Pulls the connection string from Keychain
2. Swaps the scheme from `postgresql://` → `postgresql+psycopg://` (Alembic needs psycopg3)
3. Runs `.venv/bin/alembic upgrade head` with that URL as `DATABASE_URL_SYNC`

Expected output:

```
Migrating Neon branch: dev
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade  -> 0001_initial_schema, initial schema
Done.
```

### Interactive psql against a branch

```bash
scripts/neon-psql.sh dev
```

Opens a `psql` session connected to the named branch. Useful psql commands at the prompt:

```
\dt                                  list tables
\d chunks                            describe chunks table
\di idx_chunks_embedding_hnsw        describe HNSW index
\dx                                  list installed extensions
SELECT version_num FROM alembic_version;
\q                                   quit
```

Note: psql meta-commands start with **backslash** (`\`), not forward slash (`/`).

### Verification (expected state post-migration)

From `scripts/neon-psql.sh <branch>`:

| Check | Expected |
|---|---|
| `\dt` | 14 tables (13 Phase 0 tables + `alembic_version`) |
| `\dx` | `vector`, `pg_trgm`, `btree_gin` installed |
| RLS enabled | `graph_nodes`, `graph_edges` |
| HNSW index | `idx_chunks_embedding_hnsw` |
| FTS indexes | `idx_chunks_fts_content`, `idx_documents_fts_title_preview` |
| `SELECT version_num FROM alembic_version;` | `0001_initial_schema` |

### Rotating a Neon password

1. Neon console → branch → Roles → reset password on `neondb_owner`
2. Copy the new full connection string
3. `scripts/neon-store.sh <branch>` and paste the new string (overwrites the old entry)

No other file or config changes required.

### Removing a Keychain entry

```bash
security delete-generic-password -a "<branch>" -s "neon-prbe-knowledge"
```
